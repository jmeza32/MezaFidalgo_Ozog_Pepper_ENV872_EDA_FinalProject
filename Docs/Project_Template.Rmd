# Rationale and Research Questions

Scientists at Mystic Aquarium maintain data on marine mammal and sea turtle strandings as a means of monitoring the behavior and health of these animals, always vigilant for changes in patterns that might signal an unusual event such as a viral outbreak or a toxic algal bloom. The condition of these animals reveals much about the health of our oceans.

Marine animal and sea turtle strandings can be an unusual event or indicator of the health of our oceans. Seeing patterns in the strandings of marine mammals and sea turtles can be indicative of issues that may not be transparent. Some example of these issues could be viral outbreaks or toxic algal blooms. Because humans have a close knit relationship with the ocean, 



Being able to monitor these populations  


-heath impacts on humans --> it something is harming animals, will it harm us when we consume seafood
-monitor over the years to see if there were any trends on increases in strandings

* Contains clear context for research topic
* Contains rationale for dataset of choice
* Contains one or more questions of an appropriate scope for the project

# Dataset Information
* Describes source and content of data
* Details the wrangling process from raw to processed data
* Contains a table summarizing the dataset structure


Mystic Aquarium's marine mammal and sea turtle stranding data 1976-2011
-contains whales, dolphins, and sea turtles
-number of different species in each family
-datum WGS:1984
-transforming to UTM --> 18 (32619) or 19 ()
-coordinate system: 
-raw data
-output table --> take from data_wrangling file

# Exploratory Analysis 
* Flow between text and visualizations is cohesive
* Relevant exploratory information is visualized




\newpage

# Analysis
* Flow between text and visualizations is cohesive
* Visualizations and statistical tests pertain directly to specific questions 
* Statistical results are reported in plain language with relevant statistical output in parentheses 
* Findings are reported clearly in relation to research questions


1. **Pinnipeds**:

*Question 1*: Are there years where the number of pinniped strandings are significantly different?

*Question 2*: Are there trends in pinniped strandings based off of this dataset?

2. **Whales**:

*Question 1*: <insert specific question here and add additional subsections for additional questions below, if needed>


3. **Turtles**:

*Question 1*: <insert specific question here and add additional subsections for additional questions below, if needed>




\newpage


# Summary and Conclusions
* Major findings are summarized
* Conclusions relate back to the original research context

Cetacean Stranding Analysis by Joshua Meza-Fidalgo, Jess Ozog, & Britney Pepper

This project uses a stranding dataset developed by Mystic Aquarium and managed by OBIS-SEA. The dataset compiles stranding data for pinnipeds, cetaceans, and turtles from 1976 to 2011. The strandings were broken into 4 components; pinnipeds, turtles, mysticetes, and odontocetes.  Each component was analyzed for geospatial and temporal patterns.
